# World Weather Analysis

## Objective

The current project was designed to scrape the open weather API, as well as the Google locations API services, to locate cities in the desired temperature range, along with the available hotels in the area. Additionally, there is an additional function that allows the users to select "travel itinerary" destinations to see the preferred route and associated hotels for a multi-stop journey. An example of such itinerary is provided below.
